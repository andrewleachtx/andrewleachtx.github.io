## Adding Projects
**Option** 1:

2. Open `projects/`, populate new folder with `newproject.html`, `assets/`, and `newproject.md`

**Option 2:**
3. Run `addproject.sh`

## Notes
1. Style and theme based off of this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU).

2. [MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/basic/mathematics.html) has two main points:
   1. **Inline**: `\( ... \)`
   2. **Standalone/Display**: `$$ ... $$`
   
3. ChatGPT and [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) provided information and resources for stuff like the typewriter effect and other JavaScript language quirks or "features" that I had to learn.
