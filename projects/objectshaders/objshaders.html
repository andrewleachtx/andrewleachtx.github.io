          We can render a 3D/2D graphic onto a static image, as seen in my
          <a href="../../projects/rasterizer/rasterizer.html" target="_blank"
            >rasterizer writeup</a
          >. But what if we want the scene to <strong>move</strong>? What if we
          want to <strong>interact</strong>
          with the scene with our own inputs?
        </p>

        <p>
          Open Graphics Library, or OpenGL, is a popular application we can use
          to render our 2D/3D rasterized graphics, abstracting away various
          complexities in the rendering pipeline and hardware space.
        </p>

        <p>
          When paired with
          <a href="https://www.glfw.org/" target="_blank">GLFW</a>, we can
          quickly spin up a state machine with C++, giving us control to render
          shapes, textures, and shaders in real time.

        <p>
          This is the <strong>rendering pipeline</strong> for getting any object
          stored as point data to appear on screen. There are many steps that
          are involved behind the scenes, but the ones not abstracted away from
          us in OpenGL are the <strong>vertex</strong> and
          <strong>fragment</strong> shaders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each of the steps, especially object space conversion, are critical to
          understanding how a rasterizer works. I will not be going in depth for
          my own sake. Definitely look into them if you are interested.
        </p>

        <h2 id="vertex-shader">Vertex Shader</h2>
        <p>
          To start, vertex and fragment shaders are written in GLSL, which is a
          flavor of C made for OpenGL. It comes with a set of built-in functions
          and other features that allow for you to manipulate the inputted
          vertex data across each vertex to get it ready for the fragment
          shader.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as you can see above in the rendering pipeline, the vertex shader
          converts our object from object space \( ^{o} x \) to world space \(
          ^{w} x \), then to eye/camera space \( ^{e} x \), and finally to clip
          space \( ^{c} x \).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that is a lot of definitions for space transformation. But what is
          each one and why?
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Object Space</strong>: This is the space where the object is
            defined. One way I see it is: in object space we are talking about
            where features of that object are relative to itself. It may help to
            know typically the center of the object is (0, 0, 0) in object
            space.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>World Space</strong>: Now, when we have a scene with
            multiple objects, it becomes important to perceive where these
            unique objects are positioned in relation to the same world space
            origin. This is why we convert each object (set of vertices) from
            its own object space, to world space with matrix multiplication.
            <br />
            <br />
            What you need to know is the <strong>model</strong> matrix takes us
            out of model or object space, and to world. The inverse would then
            take us from world back to object of course. The idea of using these
            4D matrices and their inverses is a common theme in graphics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eye/Camera Space</strong>: Now that we know where multiple
            objects in our scene are relative to the each other as well as an
            absolute coordinate system, we can't really perceive a partition of
            that space without the idea of a <strong>camera</strong> that can
            view them.
            <br />
            <br />
            So what we do is imagine a camera exists at some place in the world
            with its own specifications. We then use the
            <strong>view</strong> matrix to get from world space to eye, which
            gives our coordinates in relation to the camera. Note the camera
            lies at (0, 0, 0) in eye space.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clip Space</strong>: Once our object is in eye space, it is
            what the camera or us would see. But the problem is that is still a
            3D space, and our monitors are 2D. So we need to convert our 3D
            coordinates to 2D coordinates using a
            <strong>projection matrix</strong> that is creating using the camera
            specifications as stated earlier. <br />
            <br />
            Assuming a perspective view (which is the most common), we will
            effectively divide our x, y, z by the z value to get a 2D coordinate
            that will make objects further a way appear smaller, as x and y
            shrink as z grows. The matrix for perspective is something you
            should google.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          There are some interesting other things besides space conversion you
          can do per vertex in the vertex shader to achieve various effects.
          However, note that many of these effects can be applied to the same
          transformation matrices that are passed in, and so it would be more
          efficient to perform them in the render loop that calls the vertex
          shader.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ok, so now that our object is in clip space, OpenGL will handle the
          rest of the pipeline according to the program's knowledge of the
          window you tell it you will be rendering to. At that point, the
          fragment or pixel data will be rasterized by OpenGL and passed to the
          fragment shader.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="#scenes">scenes</a> above rotate over time for example.
          This is done simply by parametrizing the rotation matrix of each
          object as a function of time. You would want to do that in the CPU
          side of things (the program), not the shader. That's because the
          rotation angle is a <strong>uniform</strong> value that is the same
          for all vertices of an object.
        </p>

        <h2 id="fragment-shader">Fragment Shader</h2>
        <p>
          The fragment shader is where you are literally working at the pixel
          level. This is where we can get some pretty awesome effects for each
          pixel applied. Lighting, blurs, and other effects can be applied here
          before you output the final color any given pixel will take on screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the <a href="#scenes">scenes</a> I showed earlier are using
          shading techniques like silhouette shading, cel shading, and other
          blinn-phong material properties to achieve the look they have. My
          favorite, the jade and magenta specular is achieved with
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)"
            target="_blank"
            >quantization</a
          >, which is how cel-shading works.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are effectively checking the levels of the RGB channels, and for
          each of their values, mapping a set color for each of them based on
          where they fall in a threshold. That is how you get this level-like or
          cartoon effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are all things that you can make understandings of on your own.
          Working at the shader level is a very complex skill because it is a
          middle ground between programming and art. I personally see those as
          both being very difficult to master... which makes the intersection so
          incredible to see when it is executed well.
        </p>

        <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
        <p>
          I am pretty satisfied - no changes for this <em>specifically</em> -
          there is something else I want to do with shaders that will rely on
          knowledge from this and other projects.
